# Breast Cancer Analysis

This project aims to perform an exploratory data analysis on a breast cancer dataset to gain insights into the factors that may influence breast cancer diagnosis. The dataset contains various features extracted from breast cancer patients' cell images and corresponding diagnosis labels (malignant or benign). The analysis will focus on identifying patterns and relationships within the data to aid in early detection and better understanding of breast cancer cases.
