# Breast Cancer Analysis

This project aims to perform an exploratory data analysis on a breast cancer dataset to gain insights into the factors that may influence breast cancer diagnosis. The dataset contains various features extracted from breast cancer patients' cell images and corresponding diagnosis labels (malignant or benign). The analysis will focus on identifying patterns and relationships within the data to aid in early detection and better understanding of breast cancer cases.

T Stage =This tells you the size and location of the tumor. N Satge = N refers to whether cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes. N1, N2, and N3 indicate that cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes. A Stage: refer to M refers to whether the cancer is metastatic, which means it has spread to distant parts of the body.
## Dataset Information

The breast cancer dataset used in this project is obtained from the National Cancer Institute and is publicly available at [link to dataset source]. It consists of [number of samples] samples with [number of features] features each.

## Features

The dataset contains the following features:

1. `mean_radius`: Mean of distances from the center to points on the perimeter.
2. `mean_texture`: Mean value for the standard deviation of gray-scale values.
3. `mean_perimeter`: Mean size of the core tumor.
4. ... [List other features and their meanings]

## Target Variable

The target variable is `diagnosis`, which represents the diagnosis label and can take two values: 'M' for malignant and 'B' for benign.
