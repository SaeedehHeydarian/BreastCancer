## Introduction
Welcome to the Breast Cancer Dataset Analysis repository! This project aims to analyze and explore a breast cancer dataset using Jupyter Notebook. The dataset contains information about various attributes related to breast cancer, and the Jupyter Notebook codes perform data preprocessing, visualization, and predictive modeling.
## Dataset
The breast cancer dataset used in this project is publicly available from the Kaggle. The dataset involved female patients with infiltrating duct and lobular carcinoma breast cancer (SEER primary cites recode NOS histology codes 8522/3) diagnosed in 2006-2010. You can find more details about the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/reihanenamdari/breast-cancer).
## Installation
To run the Jupyter Notebook codes, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
